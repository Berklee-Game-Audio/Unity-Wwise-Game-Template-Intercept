# The Intercept


> Bletchley Park, 1942. A component from the Bombe machine, used to decode intercepted German messages, has gone missing. One of the cryptographers is waiting to be interviewed, under direst suspicion. Is he stupid enough to have attempted treason? Or is he clever enough to get away?

*The Intercept* is a small demo game written in [ink](http://www.github.com/inkle/ink) and Unity that we built to demonstrate how to author a simple project. See how we like to structure our own ink files, and how easy it is to use the Unity plugin within a real game. We built *The Intercept* in a couple days for a game jam!
